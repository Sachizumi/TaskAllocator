# TaskAllocator
TaskAllocator is a visualizer of task hours designed to help students with their deadlines
It automatically distributes task hours across multiple days, displaying them on a Gantt chart so users can easily see how their time is allocated. This is especially useful for students who struggle with indecision or procrastination, as it provides a structured plan that encourages them to meet their goals within a reasonable timeframe.
