# TaskAllocator
TaskAllocator no longer is just a visualizer of task hours designed to help students with their deadlines
It is a smart time-allocation assistant that transforms deadlines into structured, manageable daily plans. By visualizing workload distribution and showing real-time remaining capacity, it helps users prevent burnout and make intentional decisions about their time.
